Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System and Its Application in Road Transportation


Numerous real-world systems, including manufacturing processes, supply chains, and robotic systems, involve multiple independent entities with diverse objectives. The potential for conflicts arises from the inability of these entities to accurately predict and anticipate each other's actions. To address this challenge, we propose the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) framework. By enabling information sharing and collaborative planning among independent entities, the PHCS facilitates the preemptive resolution of potential conflicts. We apply the PHCS framework to the specific context of road transportation, resulting in the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative Road Transportation System (PHCRTS). This system leverages shared driving intentions and pre-planned trajectories to optimize traffic flow and enhance safety. Simulation experiments in a two-lane merging scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of PHCRTS, reducing vehicle time delays by 90%, increasing traffic capacity by 300%, and eliminating accidents. The PHCS framework offers a promising approach to optimize the performance and safety of complex systems with multiple independent entities.

抢先整体协同系统及其在道路交通中的应用


许多现实世界的系统，包括制造过程、供应链和机器人系统，都涉及多个具有不同目标的独立实体。由于这些实体无法准确预测和预料彼此的行为，因此存在潜在的冲突。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了抢先整体协同系统（PHCS）框架。通过启用独立实体之间的信息共享和协作规划，PHCS 有助于提前解决潜在冲突。我们将 PHCS 框架应用于道路交通的特定背景，形成了抢先整体协同道路交通系统（PHCRTS）。该系统利用共享的驾驶意图和预先规划的轨迹来优化交通流并提高安全性。在双车道合并场景中的模拟实验表明，PHCRTS 的有效性显着，可减少车辆延误 90%，增加交通容量 300%，并消除事故。PHCS 框架为优化复杂系统中多个独立实体的性能和安全性提供了一种有前景的方法。
