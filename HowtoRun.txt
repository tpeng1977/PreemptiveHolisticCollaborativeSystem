This program is used to control SUMO to do specified simulations.

I am using SUMO 1.20.0. SUMO is Eclipse SUMO - Simulation of Urban MObility.
The version of Python is 3.10.6
Required packages of Python is listed in requirements.txt.


1. Traditional Krauss/LC2013 model implementation is under directory "Krauss_LC2013".
Using run_simulation.py to get the simulation result.

2. Traditional Krauss/LC2013 without parallel acceleration lane is under directory "BaseLine"
Using run_simulation.py to get the simulation result.

3. Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System strategy is under directory "TryPreemptiveCollaborativeSystem".
Using PreemptiveMerge.py to get the simulation result.  Its performance is much better than the others.
The details can be found in the "output" directory when the program finished.
